# Global Platform GUI

A cross-platform GUI wrapper for [Global Platform Pro](https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro) by [Martin Paljak](https://github.com/martinpaljak), geared towards the [flexSecure](https://dngr.us/flexsecure).

Tons of credit go to [@Stargate01](https://github.com/stargate01), [@GrimEcho](https://forum.dangerousthings.com/u/grimecho/summary), and [@pilgrimsmaster](https://forum.dangerousthings.com/u/pilgrimsmaster/summary).

Looking for more information? Check out the [flexSecure repo docs](https://github.com/DangerousThings/flexsecure-applets/tree/master/docs).

> [!CAUTION]
> Disclaimer: Use at your own risk. I'm not liable for bricked chips.
>
> The risk is no greater than using Global Platform Pro.
> During every call to gp, this app checks its config to see if the smart card
> scanned: A, has been scanned before, and B, has a default key. If either condition
> is false, it bails. However, if you give it an incorrect key, it will send it. Enough
> consecutive, incorrect key entries will brick your device.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do accidentally enter an invalid key, entering the correct key will reset
> the counter.

## Quick Start

### Binary

Check the [latest release](https://github.com/dangerous-tac0s/global_platform_gui_qt/releases) for pre-built binaries:
- **Linux**: AppImage
- **Windows**: Portable executable
- **macOS**: DMG with signed app bundle

### From Source

Requirements:
- **Python 3.9+** (Linux/macOS)
- **Python 3.9 only** (Windows) - PyQt5 wheels for Windows require Python 3.9
- Java 8+ (for GlobalPlatformPro), Java 21+ (for Fidesmo/FDSM support)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Windows users**: You must use Python 3.9 and `requirements-win.txt`. The main `requirements.txt` contains Linux-only packages (SecretStorage, jeepney) that will fail to install on Windows.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DangerousThings/global-platform-gui.git
cd global-platform-gui

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate        # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt          # Linux/macOS
pip install -r requirements-win.txt      # Windows (Python 3.9)

# Run
python main.py
```

## Building

A Makefile is provided for building on all platforms:

```bash
# Show all build options
make help

# Build for current platform
make all

# Platform-specific builds
make linux          # Linux AppImage
make linux-signed   # Linux AppImage with GPG signature
make macos          # macOS .app bundle + DMG
make macos-signed   # macOS with GPG signature
make windows        # Windows executable (requires Python 3.9)
```

### Signing

Builds can be signed for distribution:

```bash
# GPG signing (all platforms, works with hardware tokens)
GPG_KEY=your-key-id make linux-signed

# macOS code signing + notarization
CODESIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Name (TEAMID)" make macos-signed

# Windows Authenticode (run on Windows)
set SIGNTOOL_CERT=path\to\cert.pfx
set SIGNTOOL_PASSWORD=password
build_scripts\windows\build_windows.bat
```

### Development

```bash
# Install dev dependencies
make dev

# Run tests
make test

# Format code
make format

# Check code style
make lint
```

## For CAP File Providers

If you host JavaCard applets (CAP files), you can provide a plugin definition that users can automatically import. Add a `gp-plugin.yaml` file to your repository root:

```yaml
schema_version: "1.0"

plugin:
  name: my-applet
  description: Description of what the applet does
  version: "1.0.0"
  author: Your Name

applet:
  source:
    type: github_release
    owner: your-username
    repo: your-repo
    asset_pattern: "*.cap"  # Pattern to match CAP files in releases

  metadata:
    name: My Applet
    aid: D276000085304A434F9001  # Applet AID
    storage:
      persistent: 10000  # Bytes of persistent memory required

# Optional: Custom installation UI
install_ui:
  form:
    fields:
      - id: pin
        label: "Initial PIN"
        type: text
        validation:
          pattern: "^[0-9]{4,8}$"
          message: "PIN must be 4-8 digits"

# Optional: How form values become install params
parameters:
  encoding: template
  template: "{pin_hex}"

# Optional: Management actions for installed applet
management_ui:
  actions:
    - id: change_pin
      label: "Change PIN"
      dialog:
        fields:
          - id: old_pin
            type: password
            label: "Current PIN"
          - id: new_pin
            type: password
            label: "New PIN"
      apdu_sequence:
        - apdu: "0020008204{old_pin_hex}"
          description: "Verifying current PIN..."
        - apdu: "0024008204{new_pin_hex}"
          description: "Setting new PIN..."
```

When users point Global Platform GUI at your repository, it will detect the plugin definition and offer to import it automatically.

**Supported locations:**
- `gp-plugin.yaml` or `.gp-plugin.yaml` in repo root
- `*.gp-plugin.yaml` in GitHub release assets

## Secure Storage

Global Platform GUI stores card keys securely using AES-256-GCM encryption. Keys are protected using either your system's keyring or a GPG key.

### Encryption Methods

- **System Keyring** (recommended): Uses your operating system's credential manager (GNOME Keyring, macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager)
- **GPG**: Uses a GPG key for encryption, allowing hardware token integration (YubiKey, etc.)

### Backup & Restore

You can create encrypted backups of your stored keys from **Settings → Storage → Backup & Restore**:

**Export Backup:**
1. Click "Export Backup..."
2. Choose encryption method:
   - **Password**: Encrypt with a password you choose (PBKDF2-SHA256 with 600,000 iterations)
   - **GPG Key**: Encrypt with a GPG public key
3. Choose save location (`.gpbackup` file)

**Import Backup:**
1. Click "Import Backup..."
2. Select the backup file
3. Enter password (if password-protected) or confirm GPG decryption
4. Resolve any conflicts (keep existing, use backup, or skip)

### Changing Encryption Method

To switch between System Keyring and GPG encryption:

1. Go to **Settings → Storage**
2. Click "Change Encryption Method..."
3. Select the new method and configure (GPG key ID if needed)
4. Confirm the change

> [!NOTE]
> Changing the encryption method re-encrypts all stored data. Make sure you have a backup first.

## VivoKey Apex / Fidesmo Devices

Global Platform GUI supports [Fidesmo](https://fidesmo.com/)-based devices like the **VivoKey Apex** using [FDSM](https://github.com/niclas-1/fdsm) instead of GlobalPlatform Pro.

### How Detection Works

When a card is presented, the app reads the JavaCard memory applet and compares the `persistent_total` value against a known Fidesmo fingerprint. If it matches, a confirmation dialog asks whether to enable Fidesmo mode.

Once confirmed, the card is remembered and will automatically enter Fidesmo mode on future scans.

> [!WARNING]
> Auto-detection relies on a specific memory value (`persistent_total = 84336`). If your device has a different memory profile (e.g., after significant applet installation), detection may not trigger automatically. Use the manual override described below.

### Manual Override

If auto-detection does not recognize your Fidesmo device, you can manually enable Fidesmo mode:

1. When prompted for a key, type **`FIDESMO`** (not a hex key)
2. Confirm the Fidesmo mode dialog
3. The app will remember this card for future use

### Requirements

- **Java 21+** is required for FDSM (GlobalPlatform Pro works with Java 8+)
- `fdsm.jar` must be present in the application directory
- A **Fidesmo auth token** is required to install or uninstall apps (configure in **Settings > Fidesmo**)
- Browsing the Fidesmo store and listing installed apps works without authentication

### Fidesmo Store + GP Plugins

When a Fidesmo auth token is configured, the available apps list shows both Fidesmo store apps and standard GP plugins (label: "Fidesmo Apps+"). Without a token, only Fidesmo store apps are shown (label: "Fidesmo Apps"). GP plugins can be installed on Fidesmo devices via FDSM's `--install` command, which uploads the CAP file to the Fidesmo backend for installation.

## Known Issues

- No real validation for URI record creation

## Roadmap

- [ ] Encrypted NDEF records
- [ ] Multiple NDEF records
- [ ] MIME records
- [x] VivoKey Apex / Fidesmo support
- [x] CAP file caching
- [x] Export/backup of app config and secure storage
